# Peach_Party
This is a project of course CS32 called Peach Party, a replica of Mario Party.

Peach Party is a two-player game set in a world that resembles a traditional board game.
The players must direct their avatars, Peach and Yoshi, along the squares on the game
board collecting coins and stars, while trying to avoid baddies like Bowser and Boo who
cause all sorts of trouble. When the game starts, the players may choose what board they
want to play by pressing a key from 1 to 9; each board has a different layout and set of
challenges. The winner of the game is the player who has collected the most stars and
coins during 99 seconds of game play. If both players have collected the same number of
stars, then the number of coins is used as a tie-breaker. If both players have the same
number of stars and coins, then a winner is randomly picked.

The player controlling Peach uses the following keys to direct her activity:
● To roll the die: Tab key
● To choose a left-fork on the board: the 'a' key
● To choose a right-fork on the board: the 'd' key
● To choose the up-fork on the board: the 'w' key
● To choose the down-fork on the board: the 's' key
● To fire a Vortex projectile in the current direction (if Peach has one): the back
quote ` key
The player controlling Yoshi uses the following keys to direct his activity:
● To roll the die: Enter key
7
● To choose a left-fork on the board: left arrow key
● To choose a right-fork on the board: right arrow key
● To choose the up-fork on the board: up arrow key
● To choose the down-fork on the board: down arrow key
● To fire a Vortex projectile in the current direction (if Yoshi has one): the
backslash \ key 

The project is implemented using inheritance, polymorphism, vector,linked list, pointer, etc.
